    <string name="st1">Good visual design is essential for a successful app, and color schemes are a primary component of design. The palette library is a support library that extracts prominent colors from images to help you create visually engaging apps.

You can use the palette library to design layout themes and apply custom colors to visual elements in your app. For example, you can use a palette to create a color-coordinated title card for a song based on its album cover or to adjust an app’s toolbar color when its background image changes. The Palette object gives you access to the colors in a Bitmap image while also providing six main color profiles from the bitmap to help inform your design choices.</string>
